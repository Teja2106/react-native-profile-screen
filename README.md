# React Native Profile Screen

## Design Decisions
- Built using **React Native + Expo** for fast development and cross-platform support.
- Implemented a familiar **social-style profile layout** with three content sections: **Posts**, **Clips**, and **Tagged**.
- Added **swipe navigation** using `react-native-pager-view`, allowing both tab-press and horizontal gestures.
- Integrated **animated underline** and **fade transitions** to provide smooth and polished visual feedback.
- Used **NativeWind (Tailwind classes)** for clean, maintainable styling and rapid prototyping.

---

## Mocking Approach
- Since the project is in UI-development stage, data is **mocked locally** instead of fetched from an API.
- The **Posts** section uses a mocked array of local images, displayed in a responsive 3-column grid.
- **Clips** and **Tagged** currently use placeholder content to demonstrate structure and interaction flow.
- Mocking allowed development of animations, gestures, and layout **without backend dependencies**.

## Trade-offs & Potential Improvements

### Current Trade-offs
- Local mocked data means performance with large datasets isn’t fully tested.
- A simple `ScrollView` is used; virtualized lists (like `FlatList`) were not implemented yet.
- Media playback in the Clips section is not yet integrated — only static mock content.
- Some animations may not be fully optimized for low-end devices.
- Tailwind is fast for prototyping but may limit highly customized styling in the future.

### Improvements With More Time
- Replace mocked posts with **real API integration** and support for large feeds.
- Implement full **video player functionality** for the Clips section (autoplay, fullscreen, scroll awareness).
- Build real **Tagged** content view with filtering, preview modals, and backend integration.
- Optimize animations using **React.memo**, **useMemo**, or **react-native-reanimated** for 60fps performance.
- Add **dark mode**, richer theming options, and user-customizable appearance.
- Improve **accessibility** (labels, focus order, dynamic type support).
- Add automated **unit & integration tests** (Jest + React Native Testing Library).
- Integrate **analytics and monitoring** for performance, user behavior, and crash reporting.

## Instructions to Run

Follow the steps below to run the project locally:

### **1. Clone the repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Teja2106/react-native-profile-screen.git
cd react-native-profile-screen
```
### **2. Install the packages** (used package manager - bun)
```sh
bun install
```
### **3. Start Expo Server**
```sh
bun start
```
### 4. Scan the QR Code generated by expo using your smart phone. Make sure you have the **Expo Application** installed on your device.

## Summary
This project establishes a clean and engaging **profile screen experience** with gesture-based navigation, animations, and responsive layout. Mocking enables rapid UI development, and the current architecture provides a strong foundation for future features such as backend integration, video playback, optimized rendering, and advanced theming.
